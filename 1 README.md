# Data Science: Classification Problem

Dataset: Dataset from Kaggle.
  Dataset on breast cancer.
  Total features: 32 features.
  Total objects: 569.

Goals: Predict / Classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous): 
  1 (Malignant).
  0 (Benign).

Ideas: 
  - Perform classification methods on the dataset to create the models.
  - Use evaluation metrics to interpret the goodness of the model and to compare among models of different methods.
